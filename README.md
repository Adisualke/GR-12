This project is developed as part of INSA's national cybersecurity learning initiative. Our group aims to build a practical lab environment where we simulate real-world cyber threats and develop defense strategies. The lab serves as a training ground for ethical hackers, incident responders, and vulnerability analysts in Ethiopia.
